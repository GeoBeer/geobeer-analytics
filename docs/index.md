On this website, we collect analytics of GeoBeer events, for three reasons:

- We hope our findings are of interest to our audience, our presenters, our local organising committees and sponsors as well as prospective organisers. 
- Our findings help us to keep an eye on certain metrics and we want to use them to strive to make GeoBeer events better events.
- We hope our finding as well as our open-source tools help other organisers to do the same for their events or event series. If you do similar analyses for your event, please let us know. We'd like to have a talk and potentially share data for benchmarking GeoBeer.
