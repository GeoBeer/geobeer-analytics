# Intro

On this website, we collect analytics of GeoBeer events (&rarr; [read more about GeoBeer](about.md)). We do this for three reasons:

- We hope our findings are of interest to our audience, our presenters, our local organising committees and sponsors as well as prospective organisers. 
- Our findings help us to keep an eye on certain metrics and we want to use them to strive to make GeoBeer events better events.
- We hope our finding as well as our open-source tools help other organisers to do the same for their events or event series. 

If you do similar analyses for your event, please let us know. We'd [like to talk](mailto:mail@geobeer.ch) and share data and methods for benchmarking.

Anne, Stephan, and Ralph
